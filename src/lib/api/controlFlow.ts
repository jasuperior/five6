/*
TODO how do we handle control flow?
!- does it have to be an element? can i figure out a clever way to do it wihtout an element(s)?


For lists:
- when the compoennt is rendering, dont flatten the children array at first. 
- use the array to detect the elements which may need to be replaced/added and where.
